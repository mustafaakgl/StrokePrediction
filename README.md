Stroke Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Approach
ðŸ“‹ About the Project
Every year, around 12.2 million new stroke cases occur worldwide, with 6.5 million resulting in death. The remaining 5.7 million survivors face a long and difficult journey to regain the ability to walk, speak, and carry out daily activities.

This project uses data visualization and machine learning techniques to identify the key factors that contribute to stroke risk and to predict the likelihood of future stroke occurrences.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Analyze the relationships between healthy and unhealthy lifestyle habits

Identify the most influential variables in stroke risk

Select the best-performing machine learning model and apply hyperparameter tuning
